# Examples

!!! note
    Rust implementation examples are coming soon. For now, see the Python reference examples in `references/examples/`

## Python Reference Examples

The `references/examples/` directory contains real-world usage from BinIt's production systems:

### Offline Inference Metrics

See `references/examples/offline_inference_metrics.py` for an example of:

- Loading predictions from a database
- Converting inference results to evaluation format
- Computing metrics per camera
- Storing results

### ML Deployment Validation

See `references/examples/ml_deployment_infer_on_val.py` for an example of:

- Running inference on a validation dataset
- Evaluating model performance
- Optimizing confidence thresholds
- Generating confusion matrices

## Rust Examples (Coming Soon)

Once the Rust implementation is complete, this page will include examples like:

- Basic evaluation
- Threshold optimization
- Loading from files
- Parallel processing
- Custom metrics

Stay tuned!
